# Waste Management & Recycling Hub — Backend API

- Transaction lifecycle (7-state machine with enforced transitions)
- Real M-Pesa Daraja integration (STK Push, B2C, callbacks)
- Card payment fallback (Pesapal) — optional, requires API keys
- Configurable platform commission (5-10% via `COMMISSION_RATE`)
- Seller/recycler messaging with read tracking
- WebSocket real-time notifications
- Unread message count endpoint

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI + Python
- SQLAlchemy ORM + SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- JWT auth (utility ready)
- Docker
